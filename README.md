It Takes A City Too

**Project Description/Summary:**

<!-- NEED TO UPDATE -->

An application that provides information for people in need of resources (e.g. food, shelters, etc.) - we would focus on one city and the food bank resources available for those experiencing food insecurity. As a user, they would have the ability to add a new food bank URL for a resource and add it to the database. They would be able to also rate each resource provided via the five star npm package.
